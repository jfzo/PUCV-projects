* 10 runs were executed and within each run a 3-Fold CV was performed.
* At the end of each CV step an evaluation set (testing data) was presented to the classifier. Average performance attained is presented.
* Within each run the training data was shuffled.
* Average performance measures computed over all run means (each run generated a k-fold average)

Performance over the training set:
Mean AUC (computed over all runs) is 0.7884(0.0174)
